## INTRODUCTION
Fire and Gas detection alarm systems are important tools for safeguarding our 
residence home, building, office, market, and other places. A well designed fire 
and gas system is intended to detect and in some cases automatically mitigate fire, 
flammable gas and toxic gas hazards. Proper placement of detectors is critical in 
the design of a fire and gas system to ensure that coverage is adequate to detect 
hazards at their incipient stage, in order to prevent escalation. The rates of 
increase of these three components are used in the fire alarm algorithm to 
determine the presence of a fire. The smoke sensor provides a means to detect 
smoke and to serve as an early fire warning. Heat detectors are the oldest type of 
automatic fire detection device [5]. They respond either when the detecting 
element reaches a predetermined fixed temperature or to a specified rate of 
temperature change. If a fire shouldresult, systems can be attached to extinguish 
the fire and protect other areas from the actions of the fire. Generally, the fire 
detection system and gas detection system is combined into one fire and gas 
system. A separation that may be made is to have onefire and gas system for the 
processing areas and another sub-system for the usefulness or 
office/accommodation areas.
